SAM 2:
	- Choosed first SAM 2 model to test;
	- Setup of SAM 2, resolution of errors and conflits. First tried to install SAM 2 on windows with no success. It was then decided to install on WSL. After a deep study of wsl, python and environments, it was decided to install using conda, creating a dedicated environment with the necessary dependencies;
	- A SAM 2 image predictor model checkpoint was tested with sugested images to learn the process of SAM 2;
	- The same image predictor model checkpoint was used to test on multiphase flow images ( geom1_qc2_0001 - add image to report). It was donne an interactive segmentation refinement process on the model checkpoint which consisted in selecting 10 points and label them has part of segmentation or part of background. The annotation process was used with help of LabelMe (https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme), also with some problems during the setup, for example it was not able to install on windows, and it was some needed configurations in wsl to make it able to work, in an also specific conda environment. It was donne 3 iterations of this process and each time it was used on the last refined model. In each iteration it was able to select one of three masks with a respective score. The best masks were not the ones with the best score in this case since the ones with best score segmentated more general features including all the pipe with the bubbles, and the one with less score segmentated more specific bubbles related to the labels but not all of the existant bubbles in the image.
